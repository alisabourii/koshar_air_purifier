Project Objective:
    The objective of this project is to develop a compact and portable system for monitoring and improving indoor air quality. The system uses sensors to continuously measure      oxygen and humidity levels in the room and transmits this data in real-time to a website. This allows users to monitor the air quality of their environment instantly.          Additionally, the system automatically sends notifications to alert the user when the measured values fall below or exceed predefined thresholds. The compact design of the     device allows it to be easily used in any room, and its built-in battery enables it to operate independently for extended periods. The ultimate goal of this system is to       provide a healthy and comfortable living environment indoors, optimize air quality, and minimize potential health risks.
